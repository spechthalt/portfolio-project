          <p class="mb-4">
            My interest in coding and web development began aorund the summer of
            2020 as I was searching for a career which balanced structure and
            creativity. I conncted with a mentor who began teaching me the
            foundations of web development and coding languages. This was an
            on-and-off effort as I balanced my currnet job. Though still in my
            current role, I began the SheCodes workshops in September of 2021
            and I seek to become a full-time developer soon after completing the
            course!
